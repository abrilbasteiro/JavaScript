# JavaScript

## JS Basics

The following projects were my first approach in JavaScript

____
### addEventListener-click
In this proyect I used the *document.createElement* method to create a picture and attach it to the DOM tree directly from JavaScript. Then, I included the *addEventListener* method so that it changes every time the user clicks on it.

### timer-siren
In this oportunty I used a *timer* that changes background color between red and blue every 500 miliseconds. To set the background preferences I also used the DOM method *document.body* that allows me to make changes in the document without changing HTML or CSS files.

### alerts
Here I show how to work with different pop-up notifications, including *alert* to show the first message, *prompt* to allow the users for give us their email address and, at the end, *confirm*, wich makes the user choose between two options such us staying in the web or being redirected to another site.

### arrays
In this proyect I was working with simple and multidimentional arrays, using different methods like *push*, *pop*, *sort*, *reverse* and *Array.from*

### functions
Use of basic functions, *arrow functions* and *CallBacks*. Additionally, I used the *rest* method to add extra arguments as an array and the *spread* method to use an array as a replacement for a parameter.
  
### loops
This time I utilized some of the different types of loops among which are *FOR*, *FOR...in*, *forEach*, *while*, *do...While* and the *some* method.

### switch
Working with the *switch* statement to find the price of a product.
