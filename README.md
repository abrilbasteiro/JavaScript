# JavaScript

## JS Basics

The following projects were my first approach in JavaScript

____
### addEventListener-click
In this proyect I used the *document.createElement* method to create a picture and attach it to the DOM tree directly from JavaScript. Then, I included the *addEventListener* method so that it changes every time the user clicks on it.

### timer-siren
In this oportunty I used a *timer* that changes background color between red and blue every 500 miliseconds. To set the background preferences I also used the DOM method *document.body* that allows me to make changes in the document without changing HTML or CSS files.
